/**
 * This file houses the core of the RPC functionality.
 *
 * The `UpgradedSocket` class is an extension on the WebSocket class that adds
 * custom on/off/send methods (exposed through a socket.upgraded object), set
 * up to handle automatic responses to calls. Incoming WebSocket messages are
 * routed into the `router` function, which has behaviour tailored to specific
 * origins, and makes sure that messages are always responded to.
 *
 * The `__send` function, in turn, doesn't just send data over to a remote, but
 * also waits for that remote's :response message, using Promises to make
 * sure that anyone can `await socket.upgraded.send(...)` and get a response
 * once that response has been sent back. As far as calling code is concerned,
 * this is a normal async call, and the fact that network transport happened
 * is entirely irrelevant. Callers should not care.
 *
 * The `SocketProxy` is a clever little Proxy object that extends the Function
 * built-in, which allows us to create a recursive object where any property
 * on it is a valid function to call, and doing so will send the corresponding
 * call chain over to the remote for execution and response messaging. This way,
 * we don't need to perform any "which functions are supported", we can just proxy
 * the call over the network, if it exists, it runs, if it doesn't, then we'll
 * get a result back with an `error` message that we can turn into a local throw.
